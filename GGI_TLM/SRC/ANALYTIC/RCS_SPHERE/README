mie: Calculates the RCS of spheres:
PEC 
PEC with IBC
dielectric
dielectric coated PEC
dielectric coated PEC with thin layer

There are some test input files in the directory TEST_DATA
The frequency dependent material and thin layers are described using the same
format as used in HY3D. The defining geometry files point to material and thin
layer files for materials. 

To set the core to PEC set the inner radius to 0
For no dielectric coating set the coating radius to the core radius
For A PEC with IBC set the thin layer flag to 2
For a thin layer coating dielectric set the thin layer flag to 1

The code outputs the field at the sphere centre for dielectric cases. The
position can be changed by changing the defined output position in 

 rcs.f
 rcs_ibc.f
 rcs_coated.f
 rcs_coated_ibc.f
 rcs_dielectric_ibc.f
 
 the output format is:
 
 f,theta,phi,sigma3d_db,real(Etheta),imag(Etheta),real(Ephi),imag(Ephi)
