calculate the S parameters of multiple layers
Layers may be characterised by either a frequency dependent material model
or an impedance boundary model
incident wave is TE/TM polarisation at a given angle
output are S parameters over a specified frequency range

Test data is in the input file:
Mlayer.inp

Run with

Mlayer

then input the name of the problem input file
