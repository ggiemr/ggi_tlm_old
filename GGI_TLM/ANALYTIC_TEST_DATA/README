Automatic running of Analytic solutions used for GGI_TLM validation.

*Before the test cases can be run it may be necessary to edit the file:

run_automatic_test 
 
to ensure that the correct run command is set for running mpi jobs. The line that needs to be changed is:

MPI_RUN_COMMAND="mpirun.mpich2 -np "
 
It may be necessary to define a command for running sequenctial processes. Often this will not be required
but on at least one system, with the fortran compiler set to mpif90 a sequenctial run command has had to 
be set ( set to " mpirun " in this case). The line that needs to be changed is:

SEQ_RUN_COMMAND=" "

* You will also need to edit the file:

run_test_case_include 

to set the paths to the material and cable data directories i.e. the following lines

MATERIAL_DIRECTORY="\/home\/chris\/SOFTWARE\/GGI_TLM\/TEST_DATA\/MATERIAL_DATA"
CABLE_DIRECTORY="\/home\/chris\/SOFTWARE\/GGI_TLM\/TEST_DATA\/CABLE_DATA"

Nothing else should need to be changed. 

Each test case has its own directory DIRECTORY_NAME. 

One or all of the test cases may be run using the following command:
 
run_automatic_test action
 
where action is the process to run:

action=run NAME           : run the test case
action=clean NAME         : remove all existing results
action=plot NAME          : plot the results to screen
action=plot_jpg NAME      : plot the results to jpeg file(s)
action=plot_ref NAME      : plot the results against reference results to screen
action=plot_ref_jpg NAME  : plot the results against reference results to jpeg file(s)
action=reference  NAME    : update the GGI_TLM reference results with the current set of results

NAME can be:
 one of the existing test cases (directory name) 
 or leave blank which also runs the whole set
 
example To run the RCS_SPHERE test case 
run_automatic_test run RCS_SPHERE

The test case directory should contain a shell script file:

run_automatic_test		: This file controlls the running, processing and viewing of the test case
                                : the test case directory name should be specified in this file 

All the files required to run, process and view the test case are in the directory:

PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES.

The required files are:

problem_name.inp		: an input file rquired to run the job
				: Note material files can be kept in TEST_DATA/MATERIAL_DATA directory

plot_result.plt 		: a gnuplot input file which plots the result

plot_result_with_reference.plt 	: a gnuplot input file which plots the result  along 
				: with one or more reference results

create_reference_result 	: an executable file which creates a reference result from the current result

Reference results are kept in the PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES directory.

Material files for running the test cases are in the directories:

MATERIAL_DATA		Directory with material data
