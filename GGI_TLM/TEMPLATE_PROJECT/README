In order to start a new GGI_TLM project


1. Copy the TEMPLATE_PROJECT directory to a new location and give it a new name:

cp -r TEMPLATE_PROJECT NEW_PROJECT

2. Edit the file run_automatic_test in the directory NEW_PROJECT so as to set the path to
the GGI_TLM executables. Example:

GGI_TLM_DIRECTORY=/home/chris/SOFTWARE/GGI_TLM/GGI_TLM

3. move or copy the TEMPLATE_PROBLEM directory to give it a new name:

mv TEMPLATE_PROBLEM NEW_TEST_CASE
Or
cp -r TEMPLATE_PROBLEM NEW_TEST_CASE

Note that you can create as many individual test case directories as you like.

4. In the directory NEW_TEST_CASE/PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES create a GGI_TLM input file either by
renaming and editing the existing file problem_name.inp or creating a new input file. Please note that there must be only
one input file (.inp) in the PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES directory.

edit the files:

new_problem_name.inp   		( GGI_TLM input file )
GGI_TLM_post_process_in.txt   	( GGI_TLM post processor input file )
create_reference_result		( file to save reference results )
plot_result.plt			( gnuplot file to plot results )
plot_result_with_reference.plt	( gnuplot file to plot results along with reference results )

Please ensure that the material, cable and mode files (*.vmat, *.smat, *.cable, *.mode) required to run the test case 
must either be in the PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES along with the input file or specified using the absolute path to the file. 
For example to make use of the MATERIAL_DATA or CABLE_DATA provided with the TEST_DATA, the material file names 
and cable file names must be specified in the form:

/home/chris/SOFTWARE/GGI_TLM/GGI_TLM/TEST_DATA/MATERIAL_DATA/Biological_sample_material

/home/chris/SOFTWARE/GGI_TLM/GGI_TLM/TEST_DATA/CABLE_DATA/RG58_coax


Note that the GGI_TLM_post_process_in.txt may be created by running the test case the post processing the data in the
NEW_TEST_CASE/directory then copying the GGI_TLM_post_process_in.txt created into the 
PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES directory.


5. Edit the FULL_TEST_CASE_LIST so as to include the directories for each of the GGI_TLM test cases required.
This is not a necessary step but it will allow all the test cases specified to be run with a single command. Example:

FULL_TEST_CASE_LIST="
NEW_TEST_CASE
NEW_TEST_CASE2
NEW_TEST_CASE3
"
