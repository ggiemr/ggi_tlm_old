1. Surface and volume mesh generation is fragile and crude. Needs re-writing.
  DONE 1.Problem with meshing spheres has been solved - this related to a seam in the triangulated mesh
     not being closed where phi=0 and phi=2*pi
  DONE 2. Re-written surface and volume meshing based on mesh-ray- triangle intersections for surfaces and
    cell_inside_tet test for tetrahedra. 
  
1b.  Still a problem with surface mesh generation. Some surface meshes may not be closed for closed geometry...
  Should we go back to the 'model builder' approach? It is at least predictable and has known properties i.e.
  a closed object leads to a closed mesh...
    

2. Check surface normals in GEOMETRY/build_surface_geometry.F90: 
   DONE

3. No surface normal information in mesh, surface normals are avaialable for the triangulated surface
   through the ordering of the triangle points: 
   DONE - in mesh we use the ijk_face type and set the mesh such that face xmax has normal in the 
   xmax direction and xmin face has normal in the xmin direction etc.

4. Visualisation data is very inefficient in terms of memory - points are defined more than once
   in vtk files for shared points - see also point 16.

5. trangulated mesh is GiD format which is a bit crap - Gid produces invalid triangles etc in the .msh file.
   STARTED: Initial implementation of a reader for .vtk format files

6. Do we need to develop a library for operations on xyz_point ijk_point types? Would this simplify the code? 
   DONE- at least to some extent

7. Define new ijk_point type to combine ijk_cell and ijk_face types. - also link into ijk_segment type
   DONE

8. Need to check DESCRIPTIONs in all files of GGI_TLM to ensure that there is something there and
   that it is consistent with the current action of the subroutine.
   
9. material stuff needs to be organised properly: initialise_materials, allocate_surface_materials,
   set_surface_material_filters: 
   DONE
   
10. PEC and PMC cells give the correct E and H fields at the cell centres
but maybe not the best way to implement it as allows some field through... 
Needs some thought - really need to apply the appropriate reflection coefficient 
at the cell centre and set E, H=0 at the cell centre i.e. assuming that any 
output point is 'inside' the PEC/PMC and sees no field. 
   
11. Volume material update uses the old Flaviir FE form which is not the most obvious or the most efficient. 
    DONE- changed to more intuitive TLM stub like formulation. 
   
12. Need to write info file
    STARTED
   
13. Need to write warnings file
    STARTED

14. Need to deallocate material filter data, output data etc...
    DONE

15. There may be problems if the geometry is larger than the boundary box: 
    DONE. Introduced the subroutine trim_mesh to remove cells and faces outside the
          mesh 

16. There appear to be repeated faces (maybe volumes) in the mesh. These get eliminated once the 
    data is put onto the final mesh in the solver but they do appear in plotting files (s_mesh.vtk.n)
    DONE- see 18.

17. What should the time domain field header look like now we don't have to output on every timestep?

18. problem_surfaces(surface_number)%face_list() may contain faces which also belong to other surfaces
    if surfaces intersect - also repeated faces from mesh generation (see 16.)
    This may have an impact on output_surfaces for example which makes use
    of  problem_surfaces(surface_number)%face_list()
    DONE. Redone the meshing (volume and surface) to exclude doubled faces in an individual surface

18b. Following 18 developments, a face may appear in more than one surface definition
    
19. Check correct output face side for output_surfaces in SUBROUTINE set_outputs_in_mesh()

20. Surface field output format only works properly for one surface at the moment
    DONE: We can now post_process surface field output to produce animation data.

21. write header for surface field outputs. Could maybe use write_surface_mesh_list_vtk.F90
    DONE: see 20. Header is used to produce animation data. 

22. We need to be able to swap surface normals in surface definition and/ or be able to reverse 
    asymmetric thin layer models on surfaces.
    DONE: introduced surface orientation list into surface material packet
    
23. It would be neater to combine local_cell_material and local_face_material arrays,
                                  local_cell_excitation and local_face_excitation,
                                  local_cell_output and local_face_output

24. Need to draw out scatter and connect equivalent circuits including excitation terms, materials and cable models...
    This should take into account the side of a surface for excitations
    There is a problem with sources in the presence of materials at the moment: Note - have included a check for
    sources at the same points as materials.
    Also need to sort out excitations/ Huygens surface on the correct side of a cell face in the presence 
    of a surface material.
    
24b. There is no H field excitation on surfaces at the moment. 
    
25. No shielded cables yet...
    DONE: Coax cable implemented

26. Currently limited to one unshielded condutor per cable specification - not general enough...

27. Interface to PUL_LC is a bit messy... needs to be re-written

28. Maybe write bundle cross section geometry data to one of our data structures so it can
    be plotted.
    
29. Need to work out the bundle types based on the cable geometry decomposition then
    calculate the L,C matrices on the basis of the bundle type - more memory and time efficient
    STARTED: at least to some extent. Data still transferred to bundle_segment structure

30. All junctions are assumed to be straight through for now - needs to be generalised - specified
    junction data is not incorporated into the bundle junctions yet. 
    STARTED: Needs some rigorous testing really...

31. Question: Should loads and excitations be specified on cable ends as in fieldSolve? It may help resolve the 
    ambiguity when a cable traverses a junction cell more than once.
    DONE. Loads and sources are set on cable ends, the information is put into the junction specification
    
32. Cable update uses the inefficient and poorly written FieldSolve subroutines junction() and face_junction()- need
    to re-write... We should be able to make the process work with arbitrary numbers of cables (including an internal load)
    and use only the appropriate dimension arrays directly from the bundle_segment data. 
    
33. The documentation of the cable update is not complete - we need to include the Tv matrix in the documents,
    also the arrangement of inductive/ capcitive stubs, voltage source and resistance is different in the currnet
    document to the code. We must make this consistent.
    STARTED but needs checking and include references to the documentation in the code. 
    
34. create_cable_cell_data and create_cable_face_data are not used and should be removed...
    DONE.

35. Implementation without capacitive stubs but they are included in the data structures
    OK

36. We must include checks on the input file data i.e. Do points, surfaces, volumes, materials, 
    cables etc referred to actually exist? Could be done in a subroutine which starts writing the .info file. 
    STARTED:

37. We have set filename_length and line_length in MODULE file_general. Need to migrate these 
    parameters across all the programs and subroutines.
    STARTED
    
38. We need to put some thought into whether to introduce impedances in a new way i.e at junctions.
    DONE- impedances are now introduced at junctions (on individual cables) and also as 'internal impedances'
    
39. In create_bundle_LCRG_matrices, the output is a diagonal matrix for multi-conductors...
    DONE
    
40. Need to include stability checks and warnings on cable model TLM matrices (cable_bundles.F90)
    DONE

41. There is nothing to set the direction of a wire within a segment. 
    DONE 

42. The cable matrices are set on both a geometry and a segment basis - need to sort this out... 

43. Cable meshes can easily get messed up near terminations due to the way in which the cable mesh
    is generated- need to filter out problem cable meshes as in fieldsolve. 
    STARTED - at least for the most common case in which a wire gets meshed with a short stub into the opposite cell.
    
44. Why is the TLM link line voltage array allocated one cell beyond the outer boundary?
    DONE: Not needed and changed.
    
45. What happens to surfaces on the outer boundary? 
    DONE: No surfaces like this get to the solver- see trim_mesh.F90

46. Faces between processes get updated twice, once in each of the processes which is a little wasteful.
    If we change this then it has implications for the use of:
    local_surface_material, local_surface_cable, local_surface_excitation
    STARTED: Introduce cell_face_rank(:,:) to simplify checks.
    DONE: Parallel pass data is split into two parts and each face is only updated on one processor.

47. There is still the possibility of cable source directions getting messed up... See Cable_test
    This could be a problem with Fieldsolve - needs to be checked and rationalised so that source directions
    may be specified with no ambiguity and no chance of it being changed by the meshing for example. 
    
48. Compiling with -fbounds-check stops the code working with LAPACK/BLAS stuff. 
    DONE - remove LAPACK and replace with EISPACK

49. Parallel cable algorithm is wasteful - each processor holds the whole cable mesh

50. Huygens surface copies the surface mesh into the huygens_surface structure 
    but we could use the original surface description and save this memory. We
    really only need the offset and the normal of the surface for the source update.

51. We need to store excitation functions on timesteps for cell based excitations and also
    at half timesteps for face based excitations. 
    DONE: introduced value_face in the excitation_functions structure.

52. Do we need a test case which will demonstrate/ establish the need for source scaling on cells/ faces. 

53. Huygens surface used Js and Ms terms which may not be strictly necessary.
    Maybe helpful for further developments though and as a demo of how to deal with J, M terms in TLM. 
    OK I think
    
54. Check signs in Fourier Transform exp(+jwt) or exp(-jwt)? Note: use exp(-jwt) in GGI_TLM far field calculation
    OK use exp(-jwt) everywhere.

55. Need to check the face information is correct in all excitations/ outputs. I think that the 
    min_face is only required to be set in the local_surface_output, local_surface_excitation arrays

56. Frequency_output_surface has a problem that only tangential fields are non-zero.
    Maybe we need a frequency_output_volume packet and some 'shell' ( 1 cell thick) volume geometries.
    STARTED- we now have volume output but no 'shell' elements yet
    
57. Frequency_output_surface only works on a single processor - not parallel yet.
    DONE

58. Should we become independent of Lapack? 
    DONE- use EISPACK instead and compile alongside GGI_TLM

59. We need to test the output of GGI_TLM_filter_fit especially dielectric and magnetic materials to
    check the conductivity scaling.
    STARTED
    
60. Small discrepancy between FieldSolve and GGI_TLM for the RCS_SMAT_SPHERE test case. 
    Possibly due to the difference in the volume material implementations... (NOTE: there is 
    no corresponding high frequency discrepancy for the RCS_PEC_SPHERE or RCS_SMAT_SPHERE test cases.

61. The ANALYTIC/RCS_PEC_SPHERE code could be replaced by the original RCS_SPHERE_NAG which is more general.
    We have made use of Zhang and Jin subroutines for spherical bessel functions. Is there a way
    to remove this dependency?
    STARTED: Replaced Zhang and Jin subroutines for spherical bessel functions with my own. It checks out
    for real arguments with Abramowitz and Stegun 
    
62. We must count all warnings properly - only sources in materials and on cable cells at the moment. 
    
63. The .lmesh.vtk file shows the line mesh, not the cable mesh... Terminations to surfaces are not shown
    properly. DONE: we can output cable mesh in GGI_TLM_cable_model_checks

64. Perhaps we need a 'FREE_SPACE' surface material type to avoid the use of Rsheet=1e8 type surfaces. 
    DONE

65. mode_output does not yet get the side of the surface for output correct - always side 1 at the moment.

66. Mode stirred boundary definition uses the original surface, there may be problems if the mode stirred surface 
    is overlapped by another surface with different properties - 
    perhaps we should use only those faces with PEC properties: 
    DONE- checks and only uses faces with PEC properties

67. We must remove unused and old code (numerical recipes, references to LAPACK etc) from GGI_TLM before 
    putting it online.
    DONE. The only library used is EISPACK and the source code for this is included in GGI_TLM

68. There is a problem with the IELF process I think - needs to be checked.
    OK I think

69. We cannot have cables only one cell long - the centre to centre line mesh gets confused...
    DONE

70. There is still a problem if the cable is bigger than the enclosing cell - Need to check and maybe set up a test case

71. Need to update COAX_COUPLING test case documentation - error found in the problem setup - cables were not 
    connected to the PEC end plates.  
    
72. Need to automate calculation of the number of Fourier terms in PUL_LC_tlm_interface to make things robust...
    20 terms causes overflow/ underflow errors in matrix element calculation for the MTL_crosstalk test case. 	

73. There are solution parameters which are set hard in the source code. Maybe it should be possible to change these 
    parameters from the input file - see point 72 for example...
    
74. Need to document gaussian_step_sinusoid excitation function.
