  DATE    	NAME	DESCRIPTION
  
6/11/2012	CJS	GGI_TLM_material_model_checks.F90: plot material volume cells and surface material faces
			to vtk format files for viewing with paraview.
			
7/11/2012	CJS	Set up the mat_test test case. This may be used to test GGI_TLM_material_model_checks.
	
7/11/2012	CJS	GGI_TLM_material_model_checks.F90: plot volume and surface material
			frequency responses to screen and jpeg file using system calls to gnuplot.

8/11/2012	CJS	Introduce a bundle_segment_geometry data structure and use it for calculation
			of L,C,R matrices. This is not carried through to the TLM link and stub 
			transmission line impedances due to issues with source impedances - we need to
			put some thought into whether to introduce impedances in a new way i.e at junctions
			or terminations
			
12/11/2012	CJS	Working on build_cell_centre_junction_list.F90 and create_bundle_junctions.F90
			Generalising the build of the bundle junctions working on a cable by cable basis.

13/11/2012	CJS	Continue working on build_cell_centre_junction_list.F90 and create_bundle_junctions.F90
			Generalising the build of the bundle junctions working on a cable by cable basis.
			There is now a prototype code and a prototype test case (CABLE_TEST/cable_test.inp)
			The code works for simple test cases. We need to set up some more complicated
			tests so as to fully test the code.

14/11/2012	CJS	Debugging build_cell_centre_junction_list.F90 and developing the CABLE_TEST test
			case. Working for SOME complex multi-conductor cases with multiple junctions.
			but we have found an unstable test case which is unresolved. 
			Also introduced the 'step' and 'gaussian_step' functions.
			
15/11/2012	CJS	Debugging build_cell_centre_junction_list.F90 and developing the CABLE_TEST test
			case. Still problems with complex junctions... Sorted a bug related to using
			Zlink from segment structure rather than a local copy in a correctly dimensioned array.
			Arranged that Fieldsolve and GGI_TLM give the same L and C matrices - use  
			Fictitious_radius_lc_flag=TRUE
			
16/11/2012	CJS	Finished debugging build_cell_centre_junction_list.F90. We now get excellent agreement between
                        GGI_TLM and Fieldsolve.
			Calculate Zlink, ZLstub etc on a segment geometry basis. Also include checks, output to 
			cable_info file and stabilisation of TLM cable matrices into the process. 

19/11/2012	CJS	1. Include coaxial cable type and develop new test case COAX_TEST to compare with fieldsolve. 
                        2. Start to work on face junctions: define augmented cable_junction_list packet 
			   (read_cable_junction_list.F90)
			3. Include additional segments to connect to face junctions in create_cable_meshes.F90

20/11/2012	CJS	Working on build_face_junction_list.F90 to get connections to faces working correctly.
                        The MONOPOLE test case works but fails for CABLE_TEST
			We still need to make some more complex terminationtest cases...

21/11/2012	CJS	Fixed problem which caused CABLE_TEST to fail. Include code to take account
			of cable direction in cable source and outputs.
			Started parallel implementaton in GGI_TLM solver. 

22/11/2012	CJS	Continue parallel implementaton in GGI_TLM solver. Read_mesh is OK.
                        read_cable_model.F90 		:not yet parallel
                        allocate_temporary_mesh_arrays 	:now set on local mesh

23/11/2012	CJS	Continue parallel implementaton in GGI_TLM solver. 
			Initial implementation of parallel excitations and outputs. 
			TLM_parallel_pass_data adapted to GGI_TLM from Fieldsolve.
			Cable_parallel_pass_data adapted to GGI_TLM from Fieldsolve. 
			We still need to set up structures for the parallel cable update. 
			partition_cable_mesh.F90 is compied from Fieldsolve and not developed further at the moment.

26/11/2012	CJS	Continue parallel implementaton in GGI_TLM solver.

29/11/2012	CJS	Transfer impedance for shielded cables R+jwL form. test case COAX_ZT_TEST
			Fix the MATERIAL_TEST to get agreement between GGI_TLM and Fieldsolve. 
			Note: there are still some odd mesh generation artefacts for surface meshes...
			Start to think about Huygens surface implementation and test case SPHERE_PLANE_WAVE
			-calculated the extent of all meshed surface
			-Now working on SUBROUTINE intialise_excitations.

4/12/2012	CJS	Continue Huygens surface work. 
			Move output and excitation stuff into separate directories as these will become
			much larger and have more functionality as developments progress.
			Huygens surface works OK for SPHERE_PLANE_WAVE using an internal surface
			We also have the outer boundary huygens surface working...
			
5/12/2012	CJS	Implementation of the far_field_surface using the DIPOLE test case
			for development. Working for single process, NOT in parallel.
			Introduce cell_face_rank(:,:) in order to simplify parallel stuff on faces. This 
			should make the more efficient parallel implementation easier to introduce: untested...
			Also start frequency_output_surface with no test case as yet... maybe WAVEGUIDE_RESONATOR
			
6/12/2012	CJS	Parallel implemantation of far_field_surface.
			Frequency_output_surface works OK on 1 processor - not yet parallel

10/12/2012	CJS	Bring the vector_fitting code into the GGI_TLM system (GGI_TLM_filter_fit)
			Set up some test data (FILTER_FITTING_LS22, FLTER_FITTING_CFC) and 
			integrate into run_automatic_test system
			
11/12/2012	CJS	Starting to rewrite GGI_TLM_filter_fit so as to simplify the messy code 
                        which came from Flaviir and HIRF-SE. 
			
12/12/2012	CJS	Continue to rewrite GGI_TLM_filter_fit, 
			OK apart up to the stabilisation and optimisation stages
			also set up impedance filter fit test case: FLTER_FITTING_IMPEDANCE	
			
13/12/2012	CJS	reconfigure parallel code so face updates are not done twice. It should now
                        be clear which process owns which cells and faces.
			Start to introduce filter data into cable_geometry, bundle_segment_geometry and
			bundle_segment types.

			create_bundle_segments.F90
			
			Test cases: DIPOLE_JUNCTION_LOAD - tests impedances at junctions
			Test cases: COAX_FD_TEST - tests frequency dependent cable impedance matrix
			
14/12/2012	CJS	Complete filter implementation in cable model. At the moment we have
			FD transfer impedance in coaxial cables and frequency dependent loss in

			All CAVITY tests have analytic solutions plus RCS_PEC_SPHERE
			Fixed bug in scatter.F90 - magnetic material filters didn't have filter_number set...

4/01/2013	CJS	Continue to work on FILTER_FIT - implement the filter format conversions
			required for the stabilisation and optimisation processes. This has
			involved development of a complex_polynomial type.

7/01/2013	CJS	Continue to work on FILTER_FIT - implement the optimisation of filter coefficients.
			Needs to be tidied up and tested properly but working for simple cases.

			pole-zero and pole-residue formats - test on FILTER_FIT_LS22.
			set up SAR test case in readiness for SAR packet implementation

9/01/2013	CJS	SAR packet implemented and run successfully on SAR_TEST
			Set up SAR_TEM_CELL test case and run - results differ (slightly) from Fieldsolve reference

10/01/2013	CJS	1.SAR_TEM_CELL results differ This may be a consequence of running the 
			  Fieldsolve solution without:
			  fictitious_radius_lc_flag
			  TRUE
                          Re-running fieldsolve solution with flag set: Not the case; must re-think this.

			2. Start to implement: excitation_mode_list
			                       output_mode_list
			                       mode_stir_surface_list

			4. Fix bug in set_excitations_in_mesh relating to excitation_surfaces

11/01/2013	CJS	Continue to implement excitation_mode_list packet.
			Initial implementation done but not tested
			Part of the SAR_TEM_CELL discrepancy traced to the 0.5mm wire being too large for the 
			Fieldsolve TLM cell and the cell being expanded to accomodate it. This difference has been 
			eliminated however there is still a discrepancy... Note also the output time discrepancy
			- there is a half timestep output in GGI_TLM...

14/01/2013	CJS	Continue to implement output_mode_list packet.
			Initial implementation done but not tested
			More on mode_stir_surface implementation

15/01/2013	CJS	Continue to implement mode_stir_surface packet.

24/05/2013	CJS	Update all (coax) cable test cases to reflect the change in the P matrix definition 
						
28-30/05/2013	CJS	Continue with mesh generation developments - trying a surface filling routine based on

			output surface is closer. Now we only check surface material surface lists for terminating 
			surfaces
			
19/06/2013	CJS	Implement the flags LC_correction_type_subtract_cell_inductance 
			and LC_correction_type_geometry_scale in order to make both the geometric LC matrix correction
